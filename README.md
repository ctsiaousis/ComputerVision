# ComputerVision
Simple Computer Vision algorithms written in Matlab

The assignments from the `COMP418 â€“ Computer Vision` course of [ECE](https://www.ece.tuc.gr/) department of [TUC](https://www.tuc.gr/)  

___  
### Fields  

* [Image Fusion](./hybrid_images/) An image filtering function to create hybrid images. Hybrid images are static images that change in interpretation as a function of the viewing distance.
* [Scale Invariant Keypoint Detection](./blob_detection/) A Laplacian blob detector to extract keypoints of an image. Implemented with respect to the famous [SIFT algorithm](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/ijcv04.pdf). 
* [Object Detection](./object_detection/) A simple object detector based on gradient features and sliding window classification.
